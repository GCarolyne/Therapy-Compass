<h1>Therapy Compass</h1>
<p>A web application for clients of psychotherapists who want to track there progress using a form that utilizes OPENAI agent to create a progress score which is tracked in the form of a line chart. Next the user is able to locate a therapist in the local area by taking a assessment and OPENAI recommending the type of therapy they should undertake based on their symptoms. Finally, the user is able to write notes in a personal calendar.</p>
I really enjoyed learning these three new libraries!
